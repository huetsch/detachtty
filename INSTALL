INSTALLATION

The Makefile apparently requires GNU Make; if you have some other Make
program, you'll need to edit it by hand - or install GNU Make, of course.

vi Makefile
make
make install

Or, if your distribution already contains detachtty:

- on Debian, Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux systems that use ".deb" packages,
  "apt-get install detachtty" will download and install it
- on RedHat, Fedora, CentOS and other GNU/Linux systems that use ".rpm" packages,
  "yum install detachtty" will download and install it


PORTING

detachtty is tested primarily on GNU/Linux boxes.  It should work on
 - anything with a forkpty() call
 - anything with an openpty() call that the code in forkpty.c will run on
but you may need to tune things

(1) Look at the Makefile.  Alter OS_CFLAGS, OS_LOADLIBES, OS_OBJECTS
    as necessary.

(2) If that's insufficient (e.g. you need more header files),
    add the necessary stanzas to config.h and return to step 1

(3) If that's still insufficent, do something else reasonably tasteful
    (Note from original author Daniel Barlow: NB: auto* is _not_ reasonably tasteful)

(4) Send your patch (or as last resort, your problem) to the maintainer.
    The preferred channel is to open a github issue at
    https://github.com/cosmos72/detachtty/issues
